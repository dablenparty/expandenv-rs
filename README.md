# expandenv-rs

A Rust crate for expanding environment variables, inspired by [shellexpand](https://github.com/netvl/shellexpand).

This might not be very feature complete because I made it for a CLI tool of mine called [boxunbox](https://github.com/dablenparty/boxunbox), but I figured someone else might also find some use because `shellexpand` ~~is now unmaintained~~ is actually maintained on GitLab, but it still doesn't support recursive fallbacks.
